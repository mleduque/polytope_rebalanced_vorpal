>  I've been unsatisfied for a while about the behaviour of Vorpal weapons in BG2, both when used by and against (Balors, enemy mages' Dark Planetars) the player. In the vanilla game they either allowed a save vs death with a varying penalty or in some cases (the Ravager halberd and the aforementioned Balors) killed with a % chance and no saving throw whatsoever.
>
> In the former case the danger of enemy vorpal attacks is obviated once the player reaches a level where they can always make their save vs death (which varies depending on class, race and certain items like the Periapt of Life Protection), in the latter case - unsaveable vorpals - protecting from the vorpal threat requires certain class-exclusive abilities like the rogue HLA Avoid Death or arcane Protection from Magic Weapons, frustrating those classes who lack such (and with AI improving mods you can be sure that the balor will switch targets if his intended victim casts ProMW, meaning you need to keep the rest of your party out of his line of sight).
>
> Neither of these situations is particularly good design or adds to the gameplay as the threat level of an enemy with a vorpal weapon either drops dramatically once you're past a critical level or you are forced to confront them only with specific characters. SCS and aTweaks both allowed Death Ward to block vorpal instadeath but this seems conceptually wrong to me (protection from death magic shouldn't affect the severing power of a vorpal sword, no more than it prevents a fatal backstab) and is still highly dependent on party levels, since balors usually throw a high-level remove magic at you, easily dispelling Death Ward for most SoA parties.
>
> So I decided to redesign vorpal mechanics entirely.
>
> With this mini mod vorpal proc will trigger on a % of hits varying by the weapon, but affecting only those who are at 50% hitpoints or less. This reduces the margin of safety you have when meleeing a vorpal armed enemy, relative to a comparably damaging creature without this ability, but doesn't make it either a tactical irrelevance if your death saving throw is negative or put you at risk of being one-shotted as it was before.

> Incidentally, Stoneskin/Ironskin can now foil vorpal weapons as per the 2nd edition description "Even a sword of sharpness cannot affect a creature protected by stoneskin".
>
> The breakdown of vorpal probability is as follows:
>
> - Axe of the unyielding 5% of hits (it was the least likely to score a vorpal hit even in vanilla)  
> - Silver Sword & Planetars' Swords 10% 
> - Ravager Halberd & Fallen Solars' Swords 15%
> - Balors' Swords 20%
